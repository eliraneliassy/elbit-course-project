Or perhaps you're interested assessing the changes to AngularJS before moving over? If so, then \"Getting Started with Angular\" is the book for you. To get the most out of the book, you'll need to be familiar with AngularJS 1.x, and have a good understanding of JavaScript. What You Will Learn Understand the changes made from AngularJS with side-by-side code samples to help demystify the Angular learning curve Start working with Angular's new method of implementing directives Use TypeScript to write modern, powerful Angular applications Dig in to the change detection method, and other architectural changes to make sure you know what's going on under the hood of Angular Get to work with the new router in Angular Use the new features of Angular, including pipes, and the updated features such as forms, services, and dependency injection Learn about the server-side rendering in Angular to keep your new applications SEO-friendly Enhance your applications using Ahead-of-Time compilation and Web Workers In Detail I'm delighted to see this new update and hope it helps you build amazing things with Angular. - Misko Hevery, Creator of AngularJS and Angular Angular is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. This book is the quickest way to upgrade your AngularJS knowledge to the brave new world of Angular, and get grips with the framework. It starts with an overview putting the changes of the framework in context with version 1. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so you can take advantage of Angular in its native, statically-typed environment. You'll explore the new change detection mechanism in detail, how directives and components have changed, how you create applications with Angular, and much more. Next, you'll understand how to efficienly develop forms, use the router, implement communication with HTTP services, and transform data with custom pipes. Finally, we will take a look at the Angular's Ahead-of-Time compiler, angular-cli and other such tools that help us build professional applications. By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular applications compatible with v2 and v4, that take advantage of all the new features on offer. This book is up to date for the 2.4 release and is compatible with the 4.0 release as well. Style and approach Starting with a comparison between Angular versions, this book is filled with side-by-side code examples to help highlight the changes. Each chapter then looks at major changes to the framework and is filled with small examples and sample code to get you started.",

Get up and running quickly The first chapter opens with building your first Angular app. Within the first few minutes, you'll know enough to have an app running Lots of Sample Apps and Code When you buy ng-book, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter. The code is available for download, free from our website. Table of Contents Writing your first Angular web application How Angular Works Built-in Directives Forms in Angular 2 HTTP and APIs Routing Dependency Injection Data Architecture in Angular 2 Data Architecture with Observables and RxJS Data Architecture with Redux Redux and TypeScript Data Architecture with Redux Advanced Components Testing Converting an Angular 1 app to Angular Comprehensive You'll learn core Angular concepts - from how Angular works under the hood, to rich interactive components, from in-depth testing to real-world applications Best Practices Learn Angular best practices, such as: testing, code organization, and how to structure your app for performance. We'll walk through practical, common examples of how to implement complete components of your applications Example Apps included in the book The book comes with sample apps that show you how to create: A component-based Reddit clone A real-time chat app using RxJS Observables A YouTube search-as-you-type app A Spotify search for tracks with playable song preview Plus lots more mini-examples that show you how to write Components, how to use Forms, and how to use APIs The code examples currently have over 5,500+ lines of runnable code (TypeScript, non-comment lines) What our Customers Say \"Fantastic work guys! I have no idea where I'd be with Angular without ng-book. You guys have made this SOOOO much easier to learn and keep up with. Thanks again..you guys are awesome!\" -- Jacob Cheriathundam \"Just finished ng-book2. I think it is the best learning material one can find about Angular today.\" -- Jegor Uglov FAQ What version does the book cover? This revision of the book covers up to angular-4.1.0. An updated version of the code is available for free at our website. Do I have to know Angular 1? Nope! We don't assume that you've used Angular 1. This book teaches Angular from the ground up. Of course, if you've used Angular 1, we'll point out common ideas (because there are many), but ng-book stands on its own Is ng-book an upgrade to ng-book 1? No. This is a completely new book and shares no content or code with ng-book 1. Angular 1 and Angular 2+ are two different frameworks and ng-book 1 and ng-book are two different books.",
